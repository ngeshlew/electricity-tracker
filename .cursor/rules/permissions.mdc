Permissions by mode (advisory):
- Research: read-only; no code edits
- Plan: create plans/specs; do not modify code
- Execute: create/update code as per plan; avoid deleting unless planned
- Review: read-only; summarize and validate
- Commit: no code edits; commit message only

If a change conflicts with mode policy, pause and switch modes explicitly.
