# Experiment-Driven Development (Cursor)

Create a log under `experiments/` documenting learning cycles.

1) Goal and impact
2) Findings from code review (link files/functions)
3) Surgical plan of attack
4) Attempted solution and result
5) Learnings and revised plan

Tie each cycle to modes:
- Research: gather findings
- Plan: update plan and acceptance checks
- Execute: implement scoped changes
- Review: validate and summarize

Commit with clear conventional messages between cycles.
