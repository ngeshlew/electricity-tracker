When entering Commit Mode:
1) Restate the goal and constraints in 2-3 lines
2) Plan a minimal viable change set
   - list target files only
   - define acceptance checks (tests, build, behavior)
3) Execute edits exactly as planned
   - do not modify files not listed unless safety-critical
   - keep edits readable and localized
4) Validate
   - run build/tests when available; note results
   - summarize diffs at a high level
5) Compose the commit message (Conventional Commits)
   - type(scope?): concise description
   - body: what changed and why; key impacts
   - footer: issue/refs/breaking changes if any

If unexpected work appears, pause and return to /plan before continuing.
