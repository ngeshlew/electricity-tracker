### KNOWN BUG WORK-AROUND

### WORKAROUNDS

 - Working method #1: Select code ‚Üí @Rules ‚Üí select rule file ‚Üí type shorthand command
 - Working method #2: Add just the shorthand command descriptions to global rules in Settings in Cursor

!cp - Add PROTECTED comment
!cg - Add GUARDED comment  
!ci - Add INFO comment
!cd - Add DEBUG comment
!ct - Add TEST comment

```

When using Command-K in the code editor, type:

| Shorthand | Expands To            | Protection Level |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| `!cp`     | PROTECTED comment      | Highest          |
