Use references to keep track of critical context:
- @Files: important files
- @Folders: important directories
- @Code: key functions/classes/snippets
- @Docs: specs and external docs
- @Rules: rule files

Pin frequently used files in the conversation using backticks and clear names.
Prefer citing code with file paths and minimal necessary excerpts.
