# Generate Codebase Context (llms.txt)

Produce `llms.txt` at repo root with:
- Goals of each top-level file/folder
- Function signatures with params and types (where applicable)
- Concise explanations of important functions
- ASCII map of file/module connections
- Conclusions about structure, style guide, data formats

Keep it concise and DRY. Reference files/functions with backticks.
