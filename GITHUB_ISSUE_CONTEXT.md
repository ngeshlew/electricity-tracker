## GitHub Issue #210 Content

The GitHub issue #210 contains the complete and detailed specification for the Electricity Tracker project. This is the same comprehensive content that we already reviewed in the Electricity Tracker issue files, confirming our research and planning phases were based on the correct and complete requirements.

### Key Requirements from Issue #210

#### Project Goals
- **Meter Reading Capture**: CTA button that opens a right-side panel for recording meter readings with date/time stamps
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data updates and chart refreshes when new readings are submitted
- **Consumption Analytics**: Interactive charts showing usage patterns across different time periods
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor electricity costs and identify trends
- **Data Persistence**: Save all previous readings with full history tracking
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare household usage against UK average data from Electricity Bills UK

#### Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Lewis-Linear Design System, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Decimal.js
- **Backend**: Express.js or FastAPI, PostgreSQL, WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
- **Typography**: OCR A Std monospace font for technical aesthetic
- **Charts**: Recharts library for data visualization
- **Precision Math**: Decimal.js for accurate financial calculations

#### UI/UX Design Requirements
- **Right-Side Panel**: Slide-in panel for meter reading input with Framer Motion animations
- **Monthly Breakdown**: Weekly pie chart breakdown (4 weeks per month) with drill-down functionality
- **Interactive Charts**: Click-to-drill-down functionality for detailed analysis
- **Dual View Toggle**: Switch between Money Used (Â£) and kWh Used views
- **LLM Integration**: AI-generated insights and analysis of consumption patterns

#### Reference Implementation
